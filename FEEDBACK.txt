FEEDBACK:

Well done simulating browser behavior via the Navigator class!


Good implementation of class StackList. However, usage of iterator in
   getNodeList() method which is within the same structure is unconventional.
    
    
Good testing of Navigator class, especially in clarifying
   the different test cases in your RUN.txt file.
   
   
In pop() method check when user pops from an empty
   stack. Consider either throwing an exception which the user has to
   handle (Note: here the user is the Navigator class).


Efficient implementation of clearing the stack!

-Bita.
